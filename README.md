Gail's Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals AI-900 Certification Notes

I was fortunate to have been offered a free Exam Voucher through WADSIH https://wadsih.org.au/  WA Data Science Innovation Hub (a Western Australian Government and Curtin University venture, which aims to increase the uptake, education, training and awareness of data science in Western Australia.)
Microsoft is a greater supporter of such initiatives in WA.

I was interested to see how Low Code /  No Code Data Science works and how it might fit into the business world:
  - as a tool for Project BA’s and administrators or
  - as a serious tool for Data Scientists and Engineers. 

Once you sign-in to the Azure portal and create a Workspace and a Machine Learning Resource, you then have the option to select (for Supervised Learning Only):
 - Notebook - _All code_ :-)
 - Automated ML - Low Code
 - Designer - No Code

I was impressed with the emphasis plac4s on RESPONSIBLE AI by Mocrosoft
    Fairness				 	    AI systems should treat all people fairly				
    Reliability & Safety	AI systems should perform reliably and safely			
    Privacy & Security	  AI systems should be secure and respect privacy		
    Inclusiveness			    AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
    Transparency			    AI systems should be understandable					
    Accountability			  People should be accountable for AI systems		

This Repo includes 3 files:
1) Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals.docx - My Notes from the Online Microsoft Course, 
2) Exploring data with Python - real world data.ipynb
3) Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure.docx

This Repo may contain errors - do your own study and question everything. That said, this is the material I used to pass the exam VERY convincingly.
